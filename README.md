# DistributedBanking
A Simulation Framework for Distributed Banking Systems Using Java RMI and Socket-Oriented Client Branch Architecture
This project presents the design and simulation of a heterogeneous distributed banking system operating over a multi-tiered client–server model. The architecture leverages Java RMI to establish inter-branch interoperability and enforce consistent state synchronization across distributed nodes, while socket-level client communication introduces remote transactional accessibility at the network layer.

At the system’s core lies a MySQL-backed persistence layer, functioning as the centralized data repository for transaction logs, account states, and operational metadata. A central orchestration server mediates the transactional flow, invoking atomic operations on the persistence layer while concurrently exposing a branch service abstraction to distributed branch modules. Each branch module operates as a service daemon, bound to the central server’s RMI interface, and encapsulates localized banking operations while delegating global state reconciliation tasks upstream.

Client nodes, on the other hand, dynamically bind to remote branch IP endpoints and execute socket-based invocation stubs, thereby simulating real-time inter-branch connectivity in a distributed environment without cryptographic guarantees. The overall model thus emphasizes inter-process communication, concurrency control, and distributed consistency enforcement, demonstrating how a banking system would function in a non-monolithic, decentralized deployment scenario.
